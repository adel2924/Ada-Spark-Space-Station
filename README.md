# Ada-Spark-Space-Station
This repository contains the code files for the design and implementation of a control system for a 3-person modular space station using Ada-SPARK. The control system aims to ensure the safety of the crew by enforcing various constraints, such as preventing both airlock doors from being open simultaneously, maintaining the orbit height, and managing spacewalks.
